Split.js is a 2kb unopinionated utility for resizeable split views (also called panes or frames). It handles weird edge cases so you don't have to. Split.js is CSS-driven, only using JS to recalculate CSS styles on drag. Split.js does not attach any window event listeners, instead relying on CSS for the layout when the window size changes. This keeps the JS overhead extremely low.
